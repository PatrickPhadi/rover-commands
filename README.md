# Mars Rover Commands
Mars Rover Tech Challenge

# Application Description
The application reads text file uploaded to send commands to the rover. I have ensured the rover starting point is not greater than the zone and also they cannot drive out of the boundaries of the zone. I've implemented validations to ensure the data format align with set of commands rover uses and provide end user descriptive feedback upon the submission of commands.
